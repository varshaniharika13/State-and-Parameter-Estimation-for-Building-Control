# Bayesian State and Parameter Estimation for Building Thermal Models

##  Overview

This project explores **state and parameter estimation** techniques for building thermal dynamics using a combination of **Bayesian filters/smoothers** and **optimization methods**. We focus on grey-box modeling of a residential building‚Äôs thermal behavior via RC-network ODE models and develop a modular Python package to support Model Predictive Control (MPC).

The implementation includes:
- Kalman Filter-Smoother (KFS)
- Extended Kalman Filter-Smoother (EKFS)
- Unscented Kalman Filter-Smoother (UKFS)
- Gaussian Filter-Smoother (GFS)

Parameter estimation techniques:
- State Augmentation via Bayesian Filtering
- Least Squares Estimation (LSE)
- Batch Estimation (MAP-based)
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

>  The package is designed to be modular and extensible for use with both simulated and real building data.

##  Motivation

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), buildings account for ~40% of total electricity consumption. There is a growing need to:
- Reduce energy use
- Improve occupant comfort
- Provide grid support via ancillary services

To achieve these, we rely on advanced control strategies like **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**, which depend heavily on accurate **state** and **parameter estimation**. This project addresses this need by developing robust estimation techniques for thermal models.

- **State Augmentation with Bayesian Filters** enables joint state-parameter estimation in nonlinear systems with limited data.
- **UKF and EKF** show robustness in estimating both dynamic and static parameters in benchmark systems like the pendulum.
- **MLE and Batch Estimation** provide optimization-based formulations that improve parameter accuracy using measurement uncertainty.
- The **accuracy of thermal model-based MPC** heavily depends on the correctness of the parameter estimation process.
- Euler discretization, while simple, provides sufficiently accurate results for control applications when using small time steps.
